One day, as they were sitting on their front porch, they noticed a small dog running down the street. The dog was wagging its tail and appeared to be very happy. As the dog got closer, they noticed that it had a collar with a tag that read "Duden".

They called out to the dog and it came running up to them, wagging its tail and looking up at them with big, brown eyes. They petted the dog and noticed that it was very friendly and well-behaved.

They decided to take the dog in and give it some food and water. They called the number on the tag and spoke to Duden's owner, who was very grateful that they had found their dog. The owner came over to their house and picked up Duden, thanking them for taking care of their beloved pet.

As they watched Duden run off with his owner, they couldn't help but feel happy that they had been able to help. They realized that sometimes, even the smallest acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life.

## Many Dogs

They also realized that there are many dogs like Duden out there, who are lost and in need of help. They decided to volunteer at their local animal shelter, helping to care for and find homes for dogs like Duden.

In the end, they learned that sometimes it's the small things that make the biggest impact. A simple act of kindness can brighten someone's day, and even save a life. They were grateful for the experience and were happy to have made a new friend in Duden.
